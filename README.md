# ♻️ HAXPLORE – Smart E-Waste Bin System

**Recycle Smart. Trust the Process. Get Rewarded.**

HAXPLORE is a UI/UX-first Smart E-Waste Recycling ecosystem that helps users:
- Find the right e-waste bin instantly
- Understand what item was detected and why
- Feel motivated through rewards and environmental impact

This project was built for a UI/UX-focused hackathon, emphasizing **simplicity, transparency, accessibility, and trust** over raw technical complexity.


## 🚨 Problem
Electronic waste is increasing rapidly, but recycling participation remains low because:
- Users don’t know where to dispose e-waste
- Confusion about which bin accepts which item
- No transparency in recycling process
- No incentives or motivation


## 💡 Solution: HAXPLORE
A connected system of:
- 📍 Location-based smart bin discovery
- 🤖 AI-powered waste detection (simulated)
- 🎯 Transparent value & confidence explanation
- 🎮 Rewards & gamification
- 🧑‍💼 Admin dashboard for monitoring & analytics


## 🧭 Core User Flow (≤ 3 interactions)
1. Select e-waste type
2. Find nearest compatible bin
3. Navigate → Deposit → Get rewarded 🎉
